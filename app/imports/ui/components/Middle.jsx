        <p> In recent years, the development of the e-sports industry has become increasingly prosperous. Along with the
            e-sports project itself, hardware equipment has also been a major focus, especially with e-sports monitors.
            ROCKSOUL, which has top-notch computer R&D technology, held a new product launch on Tutor ABC (T Hall) on April 20.
            A series of e-sports mouses, keyboards and headphones, such as the new RSMS and RSKB, were released on the spot. In
            this past month, ROCKSOUL just released their latest 32 and 27 inch 2K QHD Curved Gaming Monitor 2560×1440 2K
            Widescreen; Adjustable Stand, 1440P Resolution & FreeSync Samsung VA Panel. </p>

        <p>ROCKSOUL believes that “all true technological innovation comes out of the user experience and user feedback, which
            together represents gamers’ ever-evolving search for the ultimate gaming experience”. To be the best, there is no
            alternative. But to be every GAMER’S BEST FRIEND, ROCKSOUL must maintain its position at the top of the class in
            hardware device design. This is a challenge we eagerly accept, as it means even more opportunities to thrill and

            while offering the most convenient consumer purchasing platform and most attentive after-sales services; taken
            together, these goals represent the original spirit of ROCKSOUL.</p>

        <p>ROCKSOUL maintains a strategic position in America’s popular competitive gaming market, firmly rooted in our
            insistence on preserving their grassroots commitment to customer service. They sponsor not only the original
            competitive gaming national team, but also competitive gaming teams from other countries; they assist them with
            resources, technology, and other professional services.</p>

        <p>ROCKSOUL understands the importance of continuing to cultivate the most phenomenal user experiences, so that they
            can fully realize their company vision of “GAMER’ S BEST FRIEND”.</p>

        <p>The latest report released by data analysis agency Newzoo shows that in the 21- to 35-year-old American male
            demographic, the number of people watching e-sports exceeds that of baseball or ice hockey, and the proportion of
            the latter two types of fans is 22%. This data is especially important for advertisers who target young men. Newzoo
            predicts that by 2019, the e-sports industry will generate $1.1 billion in revenue. Such growth will surely attract
            the attention of investors, traditional sports groups and team owners.</p>

        <p>“Sports stars, clubs, media companies, and brands have a great interest in e-sports. This shows that the game is
            leading the media and entertainment industry into a new era of unity.” Newzoo said in an email to the media, “The
            game triggers a revolution in technology and consumer industry models, and has a unique affinity for the younger
            generation to actively engage them. Traditional digital media and sports companies have years of experience in
            providing effective communication platforms for advertisers. Furthermore, they could become strategic business
            partners.”</p>

        <p>Unlike the older generation, today’s younger population play video games from an early age, and the appreciation of
            e-sports is innate. As you age, the number of fans of e-sports will only increase. This also explains why e-sports
            and American football in the United States have little overlap in terms of fans: According to Newzoo, 56% of
            American football fans are older than 35, and 73% of e-sports fans are younger than 35 years old.</p>

        <p>On the other hand, e-sports is more in line with the younger generation’s viewing habits – they prefer Twitch,
            YouTube, and other live broadcast platforms, rather than traditional cable TV. Many baseball and ice hockey teams
            have signed an exclusive live broadcast agreement with cable TV, so they lose support from the younger generation.
            Perhaps the NBA and NFL are better for live streaming than MLB or NHL.</p>
